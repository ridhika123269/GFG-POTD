Ishaan has been given a task by his teacher. He needs to find the Nth term of a series. His teacher gives him some examples to help him out (Refer examples below). 
He is a bit weak in pattern searching so to help him his teacher told him that the Nth term is related to prime numbers. The Nth term is the difference of N and the 
closest prime number to N. Help him find the Nth term for a given N.


Code-
class Solution {
	public:
	
	    bool isPrime(int n)
	    {
	        if(n<2)
	        {
	            return false;
	        }
	        for(int i=2;i<n;i++)
	        {
	            if(n%i==0)
	            {
	                return false;
	            }
	        }
	        return true;
	    }
		int NthTerm(int N){
		    // Code here
		    if(isPrime(N))
		    {
		        return 0;
		    }
		    int i=1;
		    while(true)
		    {
		        if(isPrime(N-i) || isPrime(N+i))
		        {
		            break;
		        }
		        i++;
		    }
		    return i;
		}

};
