Geek is playing an array game. He is weak in the concepts of arrays. Geek is given two arrays arr[ ] and brr[ ] of the same size n. The array arr[ ] will be said to 
fit in array brr[ ] if by arranging the elements of both arrays, there exists a solution such that i'th element of arr[ ] is less than or equal to i'th element of brr[ ],
for each i, 0 <= i < n. Help Geek find if the given array arr[ ] will fit in array brr[ ] or not.


Code-
class Solution{
public:
    
    bool isFit(int arr[], int brr[], int n){
        // code here
        sort(arr,arr+n);
        sort(brr,brr+n);
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]>brr[i]){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
